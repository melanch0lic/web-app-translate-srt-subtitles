[woman narrating] What makes
a person extraordinary?

2
00:00:22,690 --> 00:00:25,025
Everyone wants to be normal.

3
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:26,986
But no one wants to be ordinary.

00:00:27,069 --> 00:00:28,612
[chattering]

5
00:00:28,696 --> 00:00:30,448
And what is normal?

6
00:00:30,531 --> 00:00:33,534
We all see the pretty
pictures on our feeds.

7
00:00:33,617 --> 00:00:38,914
Normal party, normal family,
normal adorable little girl.

8
00:00:38,998 --> 00:00:43,878
But, there's always
more behind the facade.

9
00:00:43,961 --> 00:00:47,298
Most of the time
Lindy seems quite normal.

10
00:00:47,381 --> 00:00:52,303
But buried deep in
her DNA she has a gift.

11
00:00:52,386 --> 00:00:56,932
Some call it a condition,
or even worse, a disorder,

12
00:00:57,016 --> 00:00:59,935
that's just
waiting to be activated

13
00:01:00,019 --> 00:01:03,564
and it makes
her anything but normal.

14
00:01:04,857 --> 00:01:07,651
When people do bad things,

15
00:01:07,735 --> 00:01:10,196
Lindy cannot control herself.

16
00:01:10,279 --> 00:01:14,408
Maybe if she'd had
that normal loving family,

17
00:01:14,492 --> 00:01:17,203
she could have
been extraordinary.

18
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:23,626
But, just like Lindy, mommy
and daddy had their own demons.

19
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:26,962
Whether it was that mummy's
pills made her so sleepy,

20
00:01:27,046 --> 00:01:31,634
or that daddy got so
angry when he drank too much,

21
00:01:31,717 --> 00:01:34,428
we'll never know.

22
00:01:34,512 --> 00:01:39,892
But whatever it was, Lindy
never got the love she needed.

23
00:01:39,975 --> 00:01:43,604
Instead, she got
angrier and angrier,

24
00:01:43,687 --> 00:01:47,358
and her disorder
got worse and worse.

25
00:01:49,527 --> 00:01:53,280
And then her parents
got her diagnosis.

26
00:01:53,364 --> 00:01:57,785
The doctors called it
Intermittent Explosive Disorder.

27
00:02:01,455 --> 00:02:05,000
She could not
live safely in the world,

28
00:02:05,084 --> 00:02:09,505
and no one would
be safe around her.

29
00:02:09,588 --> 00:02:13,509
So to live at all,
she would have to live alone,

30
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:17,638
isolated from others
till the cure could be found.

31
00:02:17,721 --> 00:02:21,725
The huge amount of cortisol
coursing through Lindy's body,

32
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:25,646
made her faster than
normal, stronger than normal,

33
00:02:25,729 --> 00:02:28,732
which made her
incredibly attractive

34
00:02:28,816 --> 00:02:31,235
to certain interested parties.

35
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,784
But her condition also
made her extremely volatile

36
00:02:44,081 --> 00:02:48,085
and far, far
angrier than normal.

37
00:02:49,753 --> 00:02:54,633
Lindy had a hair trigger.
Once provoked, she would snap.

38
00:02:56,677 --> 00:03:00,306
Until she could gain control,
she was no use to anyone.

39
00:03:00,389 --> 00:03:04,059
Her life as
a human lab rat began.

40
00:03:04,143 --> 00:03:07,021
The results were mixed.

41
00:03:10,357 --> 00:03:12,610
So they thought,
maybe the military

42
00:03:12,693 --> 00:03:14,028
would give her the structure

43
00:03:14,111 --> 00:03:16,947
to channel her unique gifts.

44
00:03:20,326 --> 00:03:21,577

Of course, all these
cures only made it worse.

56
00:04:00,866 --> 00:04:04,036

learn not to piss her off.

58
00:04:07,373 --> 00:04:11,210

and throw away the key.

60
00:04:14,004 --> 00:04:18,092
Lindy would be alone, forever.

a chance to be normal.

00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:15,055
But hold up, you should see
the first date I just served.

179
00:09:15,138 --> 00:09:16,473
I gave the guy some attitude

180
00:09:16,556 --> 00:09:19,059
and he practically
cried into his napkin.

181
00:09:19,142 --> 00:09:21,853
Yeah. And his date just sat
there and watched him squirm.

182
00:09:21,937 --> 00:09:25,232
[laughs] Oh, my God.
It was so embarrassing.

183
00:09:25,315 --> 00:09:27,377
I mean, screwing with the
customers isn't fun anymore.

184
00:09:27,401 --> 00:09:29,278
It's like my own
private freak show.

185
00:09:29,361 --> 00:09:30,362
[electricity crackles]

186
00:09:30,445 --> 00:09:31,947
The guy had, like,

187
00:09:32,030 --> 00:09:35,158
allergies to pretty much
everything on the menu.

188
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,327
[laughs] It was pathetic.

189
00:09:38,412 --> 00:09:40,497
[laughs] I know.

190
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,124
[sighs] Total losers.

191
00:09:42,207 --> 00:09:43,542
Anyway...

192
00:09:43,625 --> 00:09:44,751
[waitress grunts]

193
00:09:45,544 --> 00:09:47,754
[grunting]

194

[grunts]

195
00:09:53,302 --> 00:09:54,553
She'll call you back.

[chattering]

197
00:10:00,267 --> 00:10:01,268
Fuck!

198
00:10:03,103 --> 00:10:04,813
[groans]

[up-tempo music playing]

201
00:11:01,411 --> 00:11:02,412
[sighs]

202
00:11:07,626 --> 00:11:10,587
Oh! Ain't you
a fine little piece...

203
00:11:10,670 --> 00:11:11,755
Ow!

204
00:11:12,756 --> 00:11:13,757
Fuck!

205
00:11:20,972 --> 00:11:22,099
[Lindy] It's not working.

206
00:11:23,308 --> 00:11:25,018
Okay. Fix it!

207
00:11:26,311 --> 00:11:27,955
You're probably just
building up a tolerance.

208
00:11:27,979 --> 00:11:29,231
No, I'm not.

209
00:11:29,314 --> 00:11:31,566
Look, this is cutting-edge,
avant-garde treatment.

210
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:32,859
Okay. Well,
I'm sure you'll get

211
00:11:32,943 --> 00:11:34,319
the Nobel Prize once
you're dead.

212
00:11:34,403 --> 00:11:35,779
Is that a threat?

213
00:11:35,862 --> 00:11:37,364
Can you fix it or not?

214
00:11:38,949 --> 00:11:40,029
- All right.
- [Lindy] Okay.

215
00:11:42,661 --> 00:11:43,745
Here.

216
00:11:46,164 --> 00:11:47,958
Your emotions must
be running pretty high,

217
00:11:48,041 --> 00:11:50,043
in order for you
to override the system.

218
00:11:50,127 --> 00:11:52,671
Yeah. I have an unnaturally
high level of cortisol,

219
00:11:52,754 --> 00:11:55,215
so my emotions are
running high all the time.

220
00:11:55,298 --> 00:11:58,552
But you cannot keep
using biochemistry as an excuse,

221
00:11:58,635 --> 00:11:59,636
all the time.

222
00:12:01,596 --> 00:12:04,558
So, I'm assuming that the date
was a disappointment then?

223
00:12:04,641 --> 00:12:05,892
I mean... [sighs]

224
00:12:05,976 --> 00:12:07,394
Given that its primary function,

225
00:12:07,477 --> 00:12:10,522
was to test if I could partake
in a customary social situation

226
00:12:10,605 --> 00:12:12,041
without beating
the shit out of someone,

227
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,185
then yeah, I would say yeah.

228
00:12:13,233 --> 00:12:14,901
It was a... it was
a real disappointment.

229
00:12:14,985 --> 00:12:16,278
How badly did you hurt him?

230
00:12:16,361 --> 00:12:18,488
[sighs] I didn't
even get round to him.

231
00:12:20,157 --> 00:12:21,908
Who did you get around to?

232
00:12:21,992 --> 00:12:25,787
A waitress. Look, it doesn't
matter. Your thing failed.

233
00:12:25,871 --> 00:12:29,624
Lindy, this is not
a cure. I've told you that.

234
00:12:29,708 --> 00:12:31,348
The only way we're
going to make progress,

235
00:12:31,418 --> 00:12:34,171
is if you begin to
reconcile with your past.

236
00:12:34,254 --> 00:12:35,505
I've told you my story.

237
00:12:35,589 --> 00:12:38,884
But there's a difference,
between talking about your past,

238
00:12:38,967 --> 00:12:41,094
and actually working through it.

239
00:12:46,183 --> 00:12:47,559
[Lindy grunting]

240
00:12:47,642 --> 00:12:51,396

[Lindy exhales slowly]

243
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:58,778
Asphyxiation?

244
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,656
Jugular bleed.

245
00:13:01,740 --> 00:13:02,949
Classy.

246
00:13:03,033 --> 00:13:04,034
Here you go.

247
00:13:05,327 --> 00:13:06,745
I've upped the voltage,

248
00:13:06,828 --> 00:13:08,997
but there's only so much

249
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,832
that the human body can take.

250
00:13:10,916 --> 00:13:13,627
You don't care about
me. I'm just an experiment.

251
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:17,088
Why would I risk my
life's work if I didn't care?

252
00:13:17,172 --> 00:13:19,299
And why won't you admit
that you really like this guy?

253
00:13:19,382 --> 00:13:20,926
Because I didn't.

254
00:13:21,009 --> 00:13:22,385
Okay.

255
00:13:22,469 --> 00:13:23,595
Anyway, it doesn't matter.

256
00:13:23,678 --> 00:13:24,930
I think last night proved that

257
00:13:25,013 --> 00:13:27,015
your exposure therapy
didn't work.

258
00:13:27,098 --> 00:13:29,643
What... what... what
would you like me to do? Hmm?

259
00:13:29,726 --> 00:13:31,526
Would you like me to
put leeches on your skin?

260
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,230
Would you like me to drill
a hole,

261
00:13:33,313 --> 00:13:35,315
in your head to release
the demons?

262
00:13:35,398 --> 00:13:37,567
Would you like me to
make you drink your own urine?

263
00:13:37,651 --> 00:13:38,652
Actually tried that.

264
00:13:38,735 --> 00:13:40,237
That's disgusting.

265
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:42,864
Anyway, I think
that really you need to admit,

266
00:13:42,948 --> 00:13:44,658
that the answer to all of
your problems

267
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:47,369
is close,
human connection.

268
00:13:47,452 --> 00:13:50,163
Penis is not
gonna fix me, Dr. Freud.

269
00:13:50,247 --> 00:13:51,414
Um, I just...

270
00:13:51,498 --> 00:13:52,791
And I've tried that as well.

271
00:13:52,874 --> 00:13:54,727
[doctor] You like this guy, so
for once have a relationship.

272
00:13:54,751 --> 00:13:55,752
Oh, please fuck off.

273
00:13:55,835 --> 00:13:57,420
I'm talking about love.

274
00:13:57,504 --> 00:13:58,880
No, I don't want a boyfriend!

275
00:13:58,964 --> 00:14:01,192
We both know I'd end up knocking
his teeth down his throat.

276
00:14:01,216 --> 00:14:03,236
Maybe you won't, but I don't
know why you would walk away,

277
00:14:03,260 --> 00:14:05,053
from somebody
who made you feel something.

278
00:14:05,136 --> 00:14:06,263
Ugh!

279
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:07,639
Okay, I'm walking away
from you,

280
00:14:07,722 --> 00:14:09,033
'cause you're getting on
my nerves.

281
00:14:09,057 --> 00:14:10,058
Thank you.

282
00:14:10,141 --> 00:14:11,181
[Lindy] See you next week.

283
00:14:11,226 --> 00:14:12,686
Yeah, I can't wait.

284
00:14:14,604 --> 00:14:16,898
[upbeat music playing]

00:14:24,781 --> 00:14:26,783
[chewing]

286
00:14:33,415 --> 00:14:34,916
[Lindy] Looks so good.
[laughs]

287
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:36,167
Thank you so much.

288
00:14:36,251 --> 00:14:37,919
- [Justin] Not bad, huh?
- Well...

289
00:14:38,003 --> 00:14:39,838
Not a shitty waitress in sight!

290
00:14:40,755 --> 00:14:41,965
No.

291
00:14:42,048 --> 00:14:43,383
I'm glad you called.

292
00:14:43,466 --> 00:14:46,261
I'd hate to miss a second chance
to disappoint a pretty face.

293
00:14:46,344 --> 00:14:48,054
How are you planning
on doing that?

294
00:14:48,805 --> 00:14:50,473
I don't know.

295
00:14:50,557 --> 00:14:53,059
Depends if you find lame-ass
accountants cool or not.

296
00:14:53,143 --> 00:14:55,312
Well, that depends.
Who do you work for?

297
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:58,523
[Justin] I work for a private
company. This guy named Barry.

298
00:14:58,607 --> 00:14:59,608
You? What do you do?

299
00:14:59,691 --> 00:15:02,193
I used to work in Security.

300
00:15:02,277 --> 00:15:06,114
Okay. So you know your way
around a pair of handcuffs?

301
00:15:06,197 --> 00:15:10,702
Less BDSM, more...
bouncer in a crappy bar.

302
00:15:10,785 --> 00:15:13,163
[laughs] You're not
a bouncer!

303
00:15:13,246 --> 00:15:14,497
[chuckles] Yeah! What?

304
00:15:14,581 --> 00:15:16,100
What do you weigh?
Like a Buck-O-Eight?

305
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:17,484
- It's not about size Justin.
- No?

306
00:15:17,542 --> 00:15:18,877
Don't know what you've heard...

307
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:19,961
Then what's it about?

308
00:15:20,045 --> 00:15:23,006
Other things,
like speed and endurance,

309
00:15:23,089 --> 00:15:24,674
fearlessness, things like that.

310
00:15:24,758 --> 00:15:26,551
Okay. What happened?

311
00:15:26,635 --> 00:15:27,636
Mmm...

312
00:15:28,470 --> 00:15:29,804
You crazy bitch!

313
00:15:29,888 --> 00:15:31,264
[man shouts]

314
00:15:31,348 --> 00:15:32,849
Um...

315
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,934
I'm currently
seeking a new career path.

316
00:15:35,018 --> 00:15:36,353
Oh, you got fired.

317
00:15:36,436 --> 00:15:38,021
Yes. Well, it wasn't my fault.

318
00:15:38,104 --> 00:15:39,984
It... I mean, it was
actually entirely my fault.

319
00:15:40,023 --> 00:15:42,025
I don't know.
My heart wasn't in it.

320
00:15:43,068 --> 00:15:44,069
No?

321
00:15:45,445 --> 00:15:46,696
What is your heart in?

322
00:15:48,406 --> 00:15:50,408
I like photography.

323
00:15:50,492 --> 00:15:52,619
Yeah? What do
you take pictures of?

324
00:15:52,702 --> 00:15:54,579
Mostly, naked accountants.

325
00:15:54,663 --> 00:15:56,164
[both laugh]

326
00:15:56,247 --> 00:15:58,583
I don't know, just
people going about their lives.

327
00:15:58,667 --> 00:16:01,628
I... I just... I take pictures
on my phone sometimes for fun.

328
00:16:01,711 --> 00:16:02,754
It's not really...

329
00:16:02,837 --> 00:16:04,106
It sounds kinda
voyeuristic to me.

330
00:16:04,130 --> 00:16:05,674
Oh, I am wanking, constantly.

331
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:07,092
[laughs]

332
00:16:07,175 --> 00:16:12,013
Well, uh... I'm sorry if
I can seem kind of boring.

333
00:16:12,097 --> 00:16:14,766
Thank you for
apologizing. I am quite bored.

334
00:16:16,267 --> 00:16:17,578
There's nothing
I can do about it.

335
00:16:17,602 --> 00:16:19,372
There are a couple of
things that you could do.

336
00:16:19,396 --> 00:16:20,605
What can I do?

337
00:16:27,779 --> 00:16:29,781
[breathing heavily]

338
00:16:31,866 --> 00:16:33,201
Maybe this is a mistake.

339
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:37,163
I have to warn you,
I'm really crap at dating.

340
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:39,416
How bad could you be?

341
00:16:44,337 --> 00:16:45,547
[Lindy grunts]

342
00:16:46,631 --> 00:16:48,049
[Justin mumbles]

343
00:16:48,883 --> 00:16:49,968
Very bad.

344
00:16:51,052 --> 00:16:52,303
I'm not scared of you.

345
00:16:53,513 --> 00:16:54,889
Well, maybe you should be.

346
00:17:11,448 --> 00:17:12,907
[moaning]

347
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:18,204
[breathing heavily]

348
00:17:25,044 --> 00:17:27,297
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait! Hold...

349
00:17:30,383 --> 00:17:31,384
It's, um...

350
00:17:32,135 --> 00:17:34,179
They're... they're...

351
00:17:34,763 --> 00:17:35,764
They're a...

352
00:17:35,847 --> 00:17:36,931
Is that like a...

353
00:17:37,724 --> 00:17:39,184
Like a kinky thing or?

354
00:17:39,267 --> 00:17:41,603
No. No.

355
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,605

00:26:03,271 --> 00:26:05,189
Some guy named Barry.

534
00:26:05,273 --> 00:26:06,524
We're gonna find who did this.

535
00:26:06,607 --> 00:26:08,126
[woman] Let's not give
the lady false hope.

536
00:26:08,150 --> 00:26:09,694
Statistically, it's unlikely.

537
00:26:09,777 --> 00:26:11,213
[Vicars]
I'm not giving her anything.

538
00:26:11,237 --> 00:26:12,673
I'm reassuring
her we're gonna do our best.

539
00:26:12,697 --> 00:26:14,156
[woman]
Some people prefer honesty.

540
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:15,300
Some people prefer compassion.

541
00:26:15,324 --> 00:26:16,826
Can I see him?

542
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,244
No. Family only right now.

543
00:26:18,327 --> 00:26:19,620
Can I talk to his family?

544
00:26:19,704 --> 00:26:20,973
We haven't been
able to find anyone yet.

545
00:26:20,997 --> 00:26:22,391
But then who's
gonna mind if I see him?

546
00:26:22,415 --> 00:26:23,708
Policy's gonna mind.

547
00:26:23,791 --> 00:26:25,793
- Those are the rules.
- [Vicars] She loves rules.

548
00:26:25,876 --> 00:26:28,838
Look, we really are
very sorry, for your loss.

549
00:26:28,921 --> 00:26:30,589
[heartbeat thumping]

550
00:26:30,673 --> 00:26:31,882
- Aah!
- [Lindy grunts]

551
00:26:33,259 --> 00:26:34,635
[grunts]

552
00:26:34,719 --> 00:26:36,012
[electricity crackles]

553
00:26:40,474 --> 00:26:41,475
[sighs]

554
00:26:43,436 --> 00:26:44,913
[woman] Sounds like
your guy was involved

555
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,355
in some pretty sketchy business.

556
00:26:47,398 --> 00:26:49,775
Dodged a bullet or two.

557
00:26:49,859 --> 00:26:51,736
All right, listen.
Just give us a call,

558
00:26:51,819 --> 00:26:53,279
if you remember anything else.

559
00:26:54,155 --> 00:26:55,156
Thanks.

560
00:27:00,953 --> 00:27:02,538
What the fuck-hell was that?

561
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:04,582
She was upset.

562
00:27:04,665 --> 00:27:06,685
She's grieving, I'm... I'm
just trying to comfort her.

563
00:27:06,709 --> 00:27:08,336
I think she's angry.

564
00:27:08,419 --> 00:27:10,046
I don't think so.

565
00:27:10,921 --> 00:27:12,548
[woman]
That's why you like her.

566
00:27:12,631 --> 00:27:14,675
You like 'em with
a little rage bottled up inside.

567
00:27:14,759 --> 00:27:16,385
Better in bed,

568
00:27:16,469 --> 00:27:19,055
until it blows up in
your stupid-ass face.

569
00:27:19,138 --> 00:27:23,225
"I'm a big strong policeman."

570
00:27:23,309 --> 00:27:26,812
"Let me embrace you, and
comfort your grieving vagina."

571
00:27:28,064 --> 00:27:29,982
[whispering] I don't
wanna comfort a vagina.

572
00:27:31,650 --> 00:27:34,653
[dramatic music playing]

573
00:27:56,926 --> 00:28:01,263
[Justin whispers]
It's not a big deal.

574
00:28:25,496 --> 00:28:27,248
[both grunting]

575
00:28:27,331 --> 00:28:28,374
Stop!

576
00:28:28,457 --> 00:28:30,209
[Lindy]
You fixed me, now he's dead!

577
00:28:31,377 --> 00:28:33,003
Ah! It's not working.

578
00:28:33,087 --> 00:28:34,606
[doctor]
I'm going to get you a sedative.

579
00:28:34,630 --> 00:28:36,215
Now, you have
to stop shocking yourself.

580
00:28:36,298 --> 00:28:38,300
Lindy? Lindy?

581
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:48,352
I'm not scared of you.

582
00:29:03,701 --> 00:29:04,785
[Justin] Lindy?

583
00:29:06,537 --> 00:29:07,621
Lindy?

584
00:29:10,166 --> 00:29:12,209
[doctor] Lindy?

585
00:29:13,127 --> 00:29:14,128
Where is it?

586
00:29:14,962 --> 00:29:16,380
You're holding it.

587
00:29:18,007 --> 00:29:19,091
[electricity crackles]

588
00:29:19,175 --> 00:29:20,509
[Lindy sighs]

589
00:29:20,593 --> 00:29:21,594
How do you feel?

590
00:29:24,305 --> 00:29:26,474
I want to crush
your skull with my bare hands.

591
00:29:28,893 --> 00:29:30,478
I'm sorry about Justin.

592
00:29:32,396 --> 00:29:34,231
I mean, they acted
like it was no big deal.

593
00:29:34,982 --> 00:29:35,983
Who?

594
00:29:36,066 --> 00:29:37,318
The police.

595
00:29:37,401 --> 00:29:39,161
Well, don't focus on
them. Focus on yourself.

596
00:29:39,236 --> 00:29:41,197
It's obvious
they thought his boss

597
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,907
had something to do with it.

598
00:29:42,990 --> 00:29:45,576
Which, I mean, of course.
Right? He only had one client.

599
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:46,911
That's a bit weird, isn't it?

600
00:29:47,995 --> 00:29:49,413
I am sure they'll figure it out.

601
00:29:49,497 --> 00:29:50,748
Fuck them!

602
00:29:50,831 --> 00:29:53,167
No, I need to
find out who did this.

603
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:55,294
I have to talk to Justin's boss.

604
00:29:55,377 --> 00:29:56,712
What if
you just took a moment,

605
00:29:56,795 --> 00:29:57,835
- and you felt...
- What if

606
00:29:57,880 --> 00:29:58,881
I just snapped your neck?

607
00:29:58,964 --> 00:30:01,342
I'm gonna find
the fuckers who did this.

608
00:30:01,425 --> 00:30:03,052
[doctor]
If you go down that path,

609
00:30:03,135 --> 00:30:05,346
you are never,
ever going to get better.

610
00:30:06,138 --> 00:30:07,139
Fuck.

611
00:30:07,223 --> 00:30:08,641
You're gonna kill somebody.

612
00:30:08,724 --> 00:30:10,601
- You're fucking right I am.
- Wait!

613
00:30:10,684 --> 00:30:11,870
I have to
tell you something...

614
00:30:11,894 --> 00:30:13,521
Look! Some people cry. Some
people drink.

615
00:30:13,604 --> 00:30:16,524
Some people write
shit poetry. I hurt people.

616
00:30:16,607 --> 00:30:18,108
Might as well
put it to good use.

617
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:23,405
[chattering]

618
00:30:23,489 --> 00:30:26,492
[electronic music playing]

619
00:30:36,126 --> 00:30:38,212
[phone ringing]

620
00:30:39,672 --> 00:30:40,756
Vicars.

621
00:30:40,839 --> 00:30:42,508
[Lindy] Hi,
Detective Vicars?

622
00:30:42,591 --> 00:30:44,009
I need to talk to you.

623
00:30:44,093 --> 00:30:48,180
I... I think I have more
information but I'm scared.

624
00:30:48,264 --> 00:30:50,849
Can you come
meet me at my place?

625
00:30:50,933 --> 00:30:52,768
Yeah. Yeah,
we'll be right there.

626
00:30:58,649 --> 00:31:00,651
[electronic rock music playing]

627
00:31:01,986 --> 00:31:03,988
[chattering]

628
00:31:27,219 --> 00:31:28,554
[sniffs]

629
00:31:33,851 --> 00:31:34,852
[electricity crackles]

630
00:31:34,935 --> 00:31:35,936
[gasps]

631
00:31:49,450 --> 00:31:51,452
[siren wailing]

632
00:31:57,041 --> 00:31:58,042
[elevator bell dings]

633
00:32:39,833 --> 00:32:40,834
[sighs]

634
00:32:45,172 --> 00:32:47,174
[phone ringing]

635
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,970
Hello?

636
00:32:52,054 --> 00:32:55,057
[Vicars] Hi, Lindy,
it's Detective Vicars.

637
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,183
Lindy?

638
00:32:56,266 --> 00:32:59,645
Hello Detective. You're
angry, right?

639
00:32:59,728 --> 00:33:01,188
Why are you stealing evidence?

640
00:33:01,271 --> 00:33:03,190
Because I want to
find out what happened.

641
00:33:03,273 --> 00:33:04,775
That's my job.

642
00:33:04,858 --> 00:33:07,444
Uh-huh. How's
that going for you?

643
00:33:07,528 --> 00:33:08,821
I found you, didn't I?

644
00:33:08,904 --> 00:33:10,989
- What?
- My partner wants to bring you

645
00:33:11,073 --> 00:33:13,784
in for interfering with an
investigation, and robbery and

646
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,261
probably a whole
bunch of other stuff

647
00:33:15,285 --> 00:33:16,745
'cause she's
ridiculously thorough.

648
00:33:16,829 --> 00:33:19,498
But I wanted to give you the
chance to come in on your own

649
00:33:19,581 --> 00:33:21,375
and clear up this
misunderstanding.

650
00:33:21,458 --> 00:33:23,419
Without all the, you know, jail.

651
00:33:23,502 --> 00:33:24,837
She's on her way up now.

652
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:27,214
- Fucking balls. Where are you?
- I'm parked out front.

653
00:33:27,297 --> 00:33:28,716
She's not going
to shoot me, is she?

654
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:29,800
No, of course not.

655
00:33:29,883 --> 00:33:31,885
- [detective] Freeze!
- Fuck!

656
00:33:31,969 --> 00:33:32,970
[gunshot]

657
00:33:33,053 --> 00:33:34,054
Then again, she might...

658
00:33:34,138 --> 00:33:35,681
So here's what's gonna happen.

659
00:33:35,764 --> 00:33:38,118
You're gonna put your arms over
your head, I'm gonna cuff you,

660
00:33:38,142 --> 00:33:39,893
I'm gonna take
you down to the station,

661
00:33:39,977 --> 00:33:42,163
- and then I'm gonna book you.
- What if I have other plans?

662
00:33:42,187 --> 00:33:43,480
I'll fucking shoot you.

663
00:33:43,564 --> 00:33:45,774
And then waste a bunch
of time writing up a report,

664
00:33:45,858 --> 00:33:48,026
instead of hunting
down your boyfriend's killer.

665
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:49,737
Wasn't actually
my boyfriend yet.

666
00:33:49,820 --> 00:33:50,863
Commitment issues?

667
00:33:50,946 --> 00:33:52,448
It was early days.

668
00:33:52,531 --> 00:33:54,426
[detective] As if dating in
the city wasn't hard enough.

669
00:33:54,450 --> 00:33:56,285
You finally find a good man,

670
00:33:56,368 --> 00:33:58,579
and boom,
two bullets to the brain.

671
00:33:58,662 --> 00:34:00,164
Your partner is a trip, Vicars.

672
00:34:00,247 --> 00:34:01,832
[Vicars] Hey, Nevin...

673
00:34:01,915 --> 00:34:03,292
Is that?

674
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:06,128
Are you fucking kidding me?

675
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:07,963
Give me the phone.
Give me the phone.

676
00:34:17,681 --> 00:34:18,849
Please don't tell me,

677
00:34:18,932 --> 00:34:20,768
you just called
this murder suspect...

678
00:34:20,851 --> 00:34:22,811
[both grunting]

679
00:34:22,895 --> 00:34:24,104
[Nevin coughs, winces]

680
00:34:24,188 --> 00:34:25,689
Sorry. Having a bad day.

681
00:34:25,773 --> 00:34:27,941
- [Nevin] Freeze!
- I didn't kill him!

682
00:34:28,025 --> 00:34:30,110
Bitch. [grunts]

683
00:34:36,033 --> 00:34:38,368
- [car beeps]
- [engine starts]

684
00:34:38,452 --> 00:34:40,537
- [Vicars] Hello?
- [Lindy] Oh. Hi, Detective.

685
00:34:40,621 --> 00:34:43,874
Lindy, is everything
okay up there? Is Nevin okay?

686
00:34:43,957 --> 00:34:45,793
[Lindy] Little
busy at the moment.

687
00:34:45,876 --> 00:34:47,127
Busy doing what?

688
00:34:49,254 --> 00:34:51,340
[Lindy] Remembering
how to drive stick.

689
00:34:51,423 --> 00:34:52,424
What?

690
00:34:55,844 --> 00:34:58,472
- Stupid motherfucker.
- Ow, ow, ow.

691
00:34:59,515 --> 00:35:01,809
Holy shit! I know that sound.

692
00:35:01,892 --> 00:35:03,811
That's a McLaren 600LT Spider?

693
00:35:03,894 --> 00:35:05,270
[Lindy] It's a car.

694
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:10,025
A really fast one.

695
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,194
Are you still on the phone
with that kooky cuntcicle?

696
00:35:17,491 --> 00:35:19,326
Fucking go! Go! Go!

697
00:35:23,539 --> 00:35:25,874
Where did you learn to drive?
You even trying to catch her?

698
00:35:25,958 --> 00:35:27,209
I'm flooring it!

699
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,895
[Lindy] Guys, it's
quite hard to concentrate

700
00:35:28,919 --> 00:35:30,087
with you two bickering.

701
00:35:38,095 --> 00:35:39,930
Oh!

702
00:35:40,973 --> 00:35:42,766
- Oh, crap!
- [sirens wailing]

703
00:35:44,434 --> 00:35:46,186
- Come on, Lindy.
- [Lindy] Ooh.

704
00:35:46,270 --> 00:35:48,206
I think I'm starting to get
the hang of this stick shift.

705
00:35:48,230 --> 00:35:50,607
Oh, shit. Reverse!

706
00:35:55,946 --> 00:35:56,947
[Vicars grunts]

707
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:03,161
Damn it!

708
00:36:03,787 --> 00:36:05,372
[horns honking]

709
00:36:05,455 --> 00:36:08,500
Lindy, please stay on the phone.
I'm trying to help you.

710
00:36:08,584 --> 00:36:11,003
Okay. I really
have to concentrate now,

711
00:36:11,086 --> 00:36:12,963
so, it's been
really nice catching up.

712
00:36:13,046 --> 00:36:16,049
[Vicars] No, wait! You go
through with this and you're...

713
00:36:16,133 --> 00:36:17,593
You're on your own.

714
00:36:17,676 --> 00:36:18,677
[Lindy] Same as always.

715
00:36:20,470 --> 00:36:21,471
[Vicars] Lindy!

716
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:24,182
Damn it!

717
00:36:24,266 --> 00:36:25,434
Shit!

718
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,936
[engine revving]

719
00:36:30,939 --> 00:36:33,251
I'm trying to help you. You're
going to get somebody killed.

720
00:36:33,275 --> 00:36:35,395
If you think I had anything to
do with Justin's death,

721
00:36:35,444 --> 00:36:37,130
then you're shitter at your
jobs than I thought.

722
00:36:37,154 --> 00:36:38,339
We don't think you killed
Justin...

723
00:36:38,363 --> 00:36:39,364
Speak for yourself!

724
00:36:46,663 --> 00:36:47,873
Whoa! Argh!

725
00:36:49,833 --> 00:36:51,153
- [man 1] Get 'em!
- [man 2] Yeah!

726
00:37:25,619 --> 00:37:27,079
Ah! The fuck...

727
00:37:28,163 --> 00:37:29,790
- I'm not doing it.
- Don't bitch out!

728
00:37:29,873 --> 00:37:30,958
Fine! Fine! Fine!

729
00:37:41,718 --> 00:37:43,178
- Fuck.
- [tires squealing]

730
00:37:48,558 --> 00:37:49,893
[both groan]

731
00:38:09,037 --> 00:38:10,038
[car beeps]

732
00:38:11,373 --> 00:38:12,767
[man] If you
can't ascertain the cause,

733
00:38:12,791 --> 00:38:14,376
of the outbreak,
then you have no idea,

734
00:38:14,459 --> 00:38:16,187
how many zombies
you'll have to kill over time.

735
00:38:16,211 --> 00:38:18,380
[man 2] A lightsaber
would solve both problems.

736
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,924
We specified
a real-world scenario.

737
00:38:21,008 --> 00:38:23,218
Yeah, a real zombie apocalypse.

738
00:38:23,301 --> 00:38:25,341
Besides, there's no way
to recharge the lightsaber's

739
00:38:25,387 --> 00:38:28,056
Diatium power cell
after it ran out. [raspberry]

740
00:38:28,140 --> 00:38:30,267
Diatium power cells
don't run out of energy.

741
00:38:30,350 --> 00:38:31,518
They recycle it.

742
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:36,064
Who's in charge around here?

743
00:38:36,857 --> 00:38:39,026
I'm... I... I'm the manager.

744
00:38:39,109 --> 00:38:40,235
If you're the manager

745
00:38:40,318 --> 00:38:41,879
then you're the last person,
I want to talk to.

746
00:38:41,903 --> 00:38:43,881
I need someone who actually
knows what they're doing.

747
00:38:43,905 --> 00:38:45,785
Who's the biggest
geek you've got in this place?

748
00:38:46,783 --> 00:38:47,868
- Andy.
- Andy.

749
00:38:47,951 --> 00:38:48,952
Andy.

750
00:38:49,036 --> 00:38:51,038
[dubstep music playing]

751
00:38:54,750 --> 00:38:56,752
[footsteps approaching]

752
00:39:00,005 --> 00:39:02,049
Okay, so what? Forget
your password or something?

753
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:03,175
No.

754
00:39:03,258 --> 00:39:05,052
It's more, the man
I loved was murdered

755
00:39:05,135 --> 00:39:06,803
and I stole
his phone from the police,

756
00:39:06,887 --> 00:39:08,239
and now I've got to
track down the bad guy

757
00:39:08,263 --> 00:39:10,307
before they do, so
I can kill the shit out of them.

758
00:39:10,390 --> 00:39:12,184
Oh! Cool.

759
00:39:17,564 --> 00:39:19,399
And... we're in.

760
00:39:19,483 --> 00:39:20,525
Oh, wow. You're good.

761
00:39:20,609 --> 00:39:22,069
Obviously.

762
00:39:22,152 --> 00:39:25,238
Not much here, no
history. This must be a burner.

763
00:39:25,322 --> 00:39:26,883
Your boyfriend
a drug dealer or something?

764
00:39:26,907 --> 00:39:28,158
No, accountant.

765
00:39:28,241 --> 00:39:31,703
I mean, he wasn't...
We weren't... yet. You know.

766
00:39:31,787 --> 00:39:34,372
Yeah. Right, right. I get it.

767
00:39:34,456 --> 00:39:36,583
- I don't.
- Did your mouth just fart, Doug?

768
00:39:36,666 --> 00:39:37,834
Sorry.

769
00:39:38,502 --> 00:39:39,503
[sighs]

770
00:39:39,586 --> 00:39:40,688
[Andy] The last seven calls,

771
00:39:40,712 --> 00:39:43,340
came from
an abandoned building downtown.

772
00:39:43,423 --> 00:39:45,509
- Shady.
- What does that mean?

773
00:39:45,592 --> 00:39:47,511
[Andy] I'm not sure.
Lets see who owns it.

774
00:39:50,889 --> 00:39:53,892
Barry Kasparzki. Whoa!

775
00:39:53,975 --> 00:39:56,353
FBI files showed
ties to arms dealers.

776
00:39:57,312 --> 00:39:58,313
Holy shit!

777
00:39:58,396 --> 00:39:59,856
[Andy] That's the guy.

778
00:40:01,108 --> 00:40:02,109
How much do I owe you?

779
00:40:02,192 --> 00:40:04,361
Trust me, you can't afford me.

780
00:40:04,444 --> 00:40:05,529
Thanks.

781
00:40:06,738 --> 00:40:07,739
Oh.

Boys, boys, boys!

788

Whatever it is
you're fighting over,

789
00:41:14,055 --> 00:41:15,599
I'm sure we can all talk it out.

790
00:41:15,682 --> 00:41:16,933
[man] Money...

791
00:41:17,017 --> 00:41:19,477
Yeah. You know, like bets?

792
00:41:19,561 --> 00:41:21,646
Oh! Duh.

793
00:41:21,730 --> 00:41:23,332
Is it too late to put
a dollar on the other one?

794
00:41:23,356 --> 00:41:24,584
Just 'cause
you're a bit of a bleeder

795
00:41:24,608 --> 00:41:25,835
and you drop
your left when you hook.

796
00:41:25,859 --> 00:41:27,027
What's going on?

797
00:41:27,110 --> 00:41:30,405
Oh, are you Barry? I guess so.

798
00:41:30,488 --> 00:41:31,656
Just, you seem like,

799
00:41:31,740 --> 00:41:33,050
you have
the biggest dick in here, so...

800
00:41:33,074 --> 00:41:34,075
What do you want?

801
00:41:34,159 --> 00:41:35,577
Well, I wanted
to pick your brains,

802
00:41:35,660 --> 00:41:37,454
about the phone
calls you have with the...

803
00:41:37,537 --> 00:41:39,289
accountant that works for you.

804
00:41:39,372 --> 00:41:40,415
Did you kill him?

805
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,627
What are you? Cop? Fed?

806
00:41:43,710 --> 00:41:45,545
Oh no, girlfriend.

807
00:41:45,629 --> 00:41:46,922
I mean, I say girlfriend.

808
00:41:47,005 --> 00:41:48,965
We went on,
like, two dates but...

809
00:41:49,049 --> 00:41:51,468
you know, I was really
hopeful, I was crossing fingers.

810
00:41:51,551 --> 00:41:52,719
I didn't kill any accountant.

811
00:41:52,802 --> 00:41:54,262
- But you know who did.
- Probably!

812
00:41:54,346 --> 00:41:55,722
Well, amazing!

813
00:41:55,805 --> 00:41:58,058
I mean, that saves me
a massive headache. Barry!

814
00:41:58,141 --> 00:41:59,684
You're a sweetheart.

815
00:41:59,768 --> 00:42:01,561
I didn't say I'd tell you.

816
00:42:01,645 --> 00:42:03,623
Oh, seriously? Are you gonna
make me go through the whole,

817
00:42:03,647 --> 00:42:05,982
face-stomping,
bone-breaking routine?

818
00:42:07,442 --> 00:42:08,526
Okay, fine.

819
00:42:09,569 --> 00:42:10,570
I tell you what.

820
00:42:10,654 --> 00:42:12,614
How about I beat
three of your best guys,

821
00:42:12,697 --> 00:42:14,241
and you tell me the name?

822
00:42:14,324 --> 00:42:15,992
Sounds like fun.

823
00:42:16,076 --> 00:42:18,703
You, you and you.

824
00:42:19,704 --> 00:42:21,539
But not three in a row.

825
00:42:21,623 --> 00:42:23,041
All at the same time.

826
00:42:23,124 --> 00:42:25,210
I like a man who challenges me.

827
00:42:27,254 --> 00:42:29,714
Okay, so what
are the, like, rules?

828
00:42:29,798 --> 00:42:31,132
No rules.

829
00:42:32,384 --> 00:42:33,385
Oh.

830
00:42:34,719 --> 00:42:35,887

I'm just a bit
parched after that.

Oh! I needed that.

859
00:44:04,184 --> 00:44:06,269
Okay, you were gonna
tell me who killed Justin?

860

[Barry]
Those men back there,

861
00:44:11,316 --> 00:44:13,109
they work for me,

862
00:44:13,193 --> 00:44:16,029
they respect me and
they pay tribute to me.

863
00:44:16,112 --> 00:44:17,697
They do this,

864
00:44:17,781 --> 00:44:20,533
because they know,
that I am a man of my word.

865
00:44:20,617 --> 00:44:21,743

00:45:12,168 --> 00:45:14,003
Now, who killed him?

890
00:45:14,087 --> 00:45:15,088
I don't know.

891
00:45:15,171 --> 00:45:16,339
Don't be silly!

892
00:45:16,423 --> 00:45:17,882
Gareth Fizel!

893
00:45:17,966 --> 00:45:19,300
Gareth Fizel!

894
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,844
Yeah, he's my boss.

895
00:45:20,927 --> 00:45:22,929
Why would
he kill his accountant?

896
00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:24,681
Maybe he was skimming the books.

897
00:45:24,764 --> 00:45:26,850
Look, even the government,

898
00:45:26,933 --> 00:45:29,185
ain't dumb
enough to go after Fizel.

899
00:45:29,269 --> 00:45:31,479
Are you really that stupid?

900
00:45:31,563 --> 00:45:34,315
You know what? I think
I am exactly that stupid.

901
00:45:34,399 --> 00:45:35,942
- [electricity crackles]
- [screams]

902
00:45:36,025 --> 00:45:39,529
[electronic music playing]

903
00:45:42,240 --> 00:45:45,285
[beeping]

904
00:45:45,368 --> 00:45:46,828
[Vicars]
You enjoying that?

905
00:45:47,787 --> 00:45:50,457
Mmm. Background check came in.

906
00:45:50,540 --> 00:45:53,251
Your li'l girlfriend,
she's got a history of violence.

907
00:45:53,334 --> 00:45:55,712
Assault. Harassment.

908
00:45:55,795 --> 00:45:58,882
Interesting job history
too. Classified-type shit.

909
00:45:58,965 --> 00:46:01,634
So she's got skills
and an anger issue.

910
00:46:01,718 --> 00:46:02,927
Not a great combo.

911
00:46:03,011 --> 00:46:04,655
I still don't think,
she's the type to blow

912
00:46:04,679 --> 00:46:05,680
her boyfriend's head off.

913
00:46:05,763 --> 00:46:07,432
Hope not, or else you're next.

914
00:46:09,017 --> 00:46:11,561
She's got a short fuse.
Doesn't make her a murderer.

915
00:46:11,644 --> 00:46:13,688
That's what happens
when you don't follow protocol.

916
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:16,691
Sometimes common
sense trumps protocol.

917
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:20,570
Nah. I'm good being the superior
one in this relationship.

918
00:46:22,572 --> 00:46:24,365
Wha... Hey! What
am I supposed to eat?

919
00:46:24,449 --> 00:46:27,785
I'll see what I can swipe from
the gunshot victim next door.

920
00:46:29,412 --> 00:46:32,290
Always taking such good
care of me. Thank you, partner.

921
00:46:34,000 --> 00:46:36,085
[woman on PA, indistinct]

922

[door closes]

923
00:46:37,754 --> 00:46:39,631
[Lindy] Aw, allergic to latex?

924
00:46:39,714 --> 00:46:41,257
[clears throat] You're no fun.

925
00:46:41,341 --> 00:46:45,345
Wow! Impressive
urine output. Good for you.

926
00:46:45,428 --> 00:46:46,763
Oh, don't bother.

927
00:46:46,846 --> 00:46:48,324
I'll run away and
you'll get yourself all

928
00:46:48,348 --> 00:46:50,475
emasculated trying to catch me.

929
00:46:50,558 --> 00:46:51,935
Here. I did get a bouquet,

930
00:46:52,018 --> 00:46:53,853
but I gave it to
this woman in the elevator.

931
00:46:53,937 --> 00:46:55,188
She was... [inhales]

932
00:46:55,271 --> 00:46:57,190
Just been diagnosed
with something horrible

933
00:46:57,273 --> 00:46:59,153
and couldn't stop
crying. It was really awkward.

934
00:46:59,817 --> 00:47:01,027
Glad to see you're all right.

935
00:47:01,110 --> 00:47:03,196
I wanted to say thank
you for warning me and...

936
00:47:03,279 --> 00:47:04,489
I wasn't warning you.

937
00:47:04,572 --> 00:47:06,452
I was giving you a chance
to do the right thing.

938
00:47:06,533 --> 00:47:08,368
Well, thank you for
giving me the chance.

939
00:47:09,536 --> 00:47:11,162
Look, I found
out who killed Justin.

940
00:47:11,246 --> 00:47:12,664
Who?

941
00:47:12,747 --> 00:47:13,998
Gareth Fizel.

942
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,960
You got any proof?

943
00:47:17,043 --> 00:47:19,212
Well, obviously
not the sort of person

944
00:47:19,295 --> 00:47:21,005
who gives a fuck about proof.

945
00:47:21,089 --> 00:47:23,007
What do you know about him?

946
00:47:23,091 --> 00:47:24,425
Billionaire recluse

947
00:47:24,509 --> 00:47:26,403
with his fingers in a bunch
of different illegal pies.

948
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:28,054
He's pretty much untouchable.

949
00:47:28,137 --> 00:47:29,305
Oh, I'm gonna touch him.

950
00:47:29,389 --> 00:47:31,015
Hard.

951
00:47:31,099 --> 00:47:33,268
And a lot. And not in
a way he's gonna enjoy.

952
00:47:34,018 --> 00:47:35,520
Where can I find him?

953
00:47:35,603 --> 00:47:37,438
Why you doing this?

954
00:47:37,522 --> 00:47:40,483
Is this Justin really
worth you risking your life for?

955
00:47:40,567 --> 00:47:42,819
Yeah, it was early
days. I didn't know him.

956
00:47:42,902 --> 00:47:44,862
I didn't know half
the shit he was caught up in.

957
00:47:44,946 --> 00:47:47,699
But I do know,
he was a decent guy.

958
00:47:47,782 --> 00:47:49,492
He didn't
deserve to die like that.

959
00:47:49,576 --> 00:47:50,577
Nobody does.

960
00:47:50,660 --> 00:47:52,036
Well, no, but...

961
00:47:52,120 --> 00:47:54,539
Most people make me
want to run away screaming,

962
00:47:54,622 --> 00:47:56,708
or snap their fingers
off. He was...

963
00:47:57,667 --> 00:47:58,918
[sighs] He was nice.

964
00:47:59,002 --> 00:48:01,212
He was... He was really nice.

965
00:48:01,296 --> 00:48:02,839
There's lots of
nice guys out there.

966
00:48:02,922 --> 00:48:04,299
Yeah.

967
00:48:04,382 --> 00:48:06,175
They're all frightened of me.

968
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:07,885
He wanted to cook me fish.

969
00:48:12,056 --> 00:48:13,558
The Imperion Tower. Downtown.

970
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:15,852
Thank you.

971
00:48:15,935 --> 00:48:17,395
I can't let you go there.

972
00:48:17,478 --> 00:48:19,814
[Lindy] You're not in a great
position to stop me, are you?

973
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:21,107
But I am.

974
00:48:22,609 --> 00:48:24,027
Get back!

Sorry.

Oh, come on.

You're not
gonna start shit in here.

1007

I will shoot you.

There's no one
here by that name.

Okay.

It's gonna be a lot
less painful for you,

1029
00:52:10,336 --> 00:52:11,980
if you just point me
in the right direction.

1030
00:52:12,004 --> 00:52:13,005
[man] Good evening.

1031
00:52:14,549 --> 00:52:15,925
Can I be of assistance?

1032
00:52:16,008 --> 00:52:19,053
Mr. Delacroix, this woman...

1033
00:52:19,136 --> 00:52:21,514
is asking for a Mr. Fizel.

1034
00:52:21,597 --> 00:52:23,307
And she threatened me.

1035
00:52:25,142 --> 00:52:26,435
You're fired.

1036
00:52:26,519 --> 00:52:27,520
For what?

[elevator bell dings]

1042
00:53:03,055 --> 00:53:04,199
That's strange.
I would've thought,

1043
00:53:04,223 --> 00:53:06,017
the big cheese
would be on the top floor.

1044
00:53:07,852 --> 00:53:09,186
He is.

really fucked up date.

Head of. And you are?

About to pee my pants.

1055
00:53:34,128 --> 00:53:36,631
I had, like, four
Red Bulls on the way here.

1056
00:53:36,714 --> 00:53:38,799
Is that what
the drain in the floor is for?

1057
00:53:40,259 --> 00:53:41,761
What are these for?

1058
00:53:41,844 --> 00:53:43,804
That is a really
bad idea to take those.

1059
00:53:43,888 --> 00:53:46,307
- I need them.
- What for?

1060
00:53:46,390 --> 00:53:47,934

Why are you here?

[Lindy]
I need to see your boss.

Regarding what?

1065
00:53:54,357 --> 00:53:55,608
He killed Justin.

00:54:03,741 --> 00:54:05,993
who's cooking the books
for a shady arms dealer,

1071
00:54:06,077 --> 00:54:08,537
suddenly assassinated
and tossed in a dumpster.

1072
00:54:08,621 --> 00:54:11,290
Sounds like he had
information to disclose.

1073
00:54:11,374 --> 00:54:13,584
Seemed like a solid lead.

1074
00:54:13,668 --> 00:54:15,628
I mean, that and Barry told me.

1075
00:54:16,796 --> 00:54:18,506
Are you a relation
of the deceased?

1076
00:54:18,589 --> 00:54:20,675
No. I was...

1077
00:54:21,592 --> 00:54:23,844
- Not, we were...
- I see.

1078
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,513
- Do you?
- No.

1079
00:54:25,596 --> 00:54:27,515
Nor do I desire to.

1080
00:54:27,598 --> 00:54:30,977
I am going to give you a chance
to vacate the premises,

1081
00:54:31,060 --> 00:54:32,937
- peacefully.
- [Lindy sighs]

1082
00:54:33,020 --> 00:54:34,480
What if I don't?

1083
00:54:34,563 --> 00:54:37,900
You will find out what
the drainage system is for.

1084
00:54:37,984 --> 00:54:40,903
And I will be keeping those.

1085
00:54:45,241 --> 00:54:46,742
[sighs]

1086
00:54:51,455 --> 00:54:53,457
- [car door closes]
- [engine starts]

[menacing music playing]

1088
00:55:07,555 --> 00:55:09,640
[panting]

1089
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:11,183
[whispering] My life vest...

1090
00:55:14,353 --> 00:55:16,022
I need my vest.

1091
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:36,667
[button clicks]

1092
00:55:50,431 --> 00:55:52,433
[whirring]

1093
00:56:03,611 --> 00:56:05,946
Apologies for the disturbance.

1094
00:56:06,030 --> 00:56:07,656
We've had a visitor, a woman.

1095
00:56:08,949 --> 00:56:10,701
She's peculiar.

1096
00:56:12,703 --> 00:56:14,205
I need to get out of the car.

1097
00:56:16,207 --> 00:56:18,501
Can you let me out of the car?

1098
00:56:18,584 --> 00:56:21,170
Look, miss, I don't
want to seem overly familiar,

1099
00:56:21,253 --> 00:56:22,421
but I gotta take you home.

1100
00:56:22,505 --> 00:56:24,465
[Lindy]
Unlock this door and let me out!

1101
00:56:25,382 --> 00:56:27,384
Asking about an accountant.

1102
00:56:29,678 --> 00:56:31,138
A concern?

1103
00:56:32,306 --> 00:56:33,891
Let me out of
the car for your sake!

1104
00:56:33,974 --> 00:56:35,559
- Miss!
- Let me out!

1105
00:56:35,643 --> 00:56:37,019
Let me out!

1106
00:56:37,103 --> 00:56:38,646
I wasn't sure
who may have been aware,

1107
00:56:38,729 --> 00:56:41,273
of her presence
here, so I opted to let her go.

1108
00:56:42,525 --> 00:56:46,362
But enough of
a concern to bother me with.

1109
00:56:46,445 --> 00:56:48,364
- [tires screeching]
- [both grunting]

1110
00:56:53,327 --> 00:56:54,411
[driver groans]

1111
00:56:57,039 --> 00:56:58,207
I'm sorry.

1112
00:56:58,290 --> 00:56:59,416
I'm sorry!

1113
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:09,552
More like an unknown variable.

1114
00:57:09,635 --> 00:57:15,099
You know... I don't
like unknown variables.

1115
00:57:15,182 --> 00:57:16,433
Deal with her.

1116
00:57:21,480 --> 00:57:22,815
[door unlocks]

1117
00:57:27,361 --> 00:57:28,445
[Lindy] Please help me?

1118
00:57:28,529 --> 00:57:29,905
Oh, fuck!

1119
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,700
What are you doing here?

1120
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:34,493
I lost my device.

1121
00:57:34,577 --> 00:57:36,954
Do you have another
here? I really need it. Please?

1122
00:57:40,124 --> 00:57:41,792
What happened to the lamp?

1123
00:57:41,876 --> 00:57:44,378
I figured, if things
got really bad, I could

1124
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:45,796
bite down on both ends.

1125
00:57:46,964 --> 00:57:48,174
Don't do that.

1126
00:57:55,931 --> 00:57:56,932
Sorry.

1127
00:57:57,725 --> 00:57:59,643
[doctor] Thanks.

1128
00:57:59,727 --> 00:58:02,104
Have you seen
that movie Old Yeller?

1129
00:58:02,188 --> 00:58:03,355
Uh, yeah. It's a classic.

1130
00:58:03,439 --> 00:58:05,691
I've never seen it,
but I know how it ends.

1131
00:58:05,774 --> 00:58:08,861
So if I... try anything,

1132
00:58:09,737 --> 00:58:10,738
kill me.

1133
00:58:17,077 --> 00:58:18,329
If I make this thing for you,

1134
00:58:18,412 --> 00:58:19,830
will you stop
going after this guy?

1135
00:58:22,249 --> 00:58:23,667
No.

1136
00:58:23,751 --> 00:58:26,295
But I can promise more
innocent people won't get hurt

1137
00:58:26,378 --> 00:58:27,546
along the way.

1138
00:58:29,798 --> 00:58:30,799
Okay.

1139
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:37,556
Do you want some Chinese food?

1140
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:40,684
There's Kung Pao chicken
and sweet and sour... something,

1141
00:58:40,768 --> 00:58:43,604
and some... egg
rolls and all that.

1142
00:58:43,687 --> 00:58:45,105
You should eat something.

1143
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,941
Don't touch
the shrimp fried rice.

1144
00:58:47,942 --> 00:58:50,027
- That's mine.
- [chuckles]

1145
00:58:53,530 --> 00:58:55,199
I'll get the vest.

1146
00:58:55,282 --> 00:58:58,285
[footsteps departing]

1147
00:58:58,369 --> 00:58:59,370

[gas hissing]

1151
01:00:27,499 --> 01:00:29,918
Je... Jesus!
What are you doing?

1152
01:00:30,002 --> 01:00:31,479
I'm hiding from
the beat cops down the street.

1153
01:00:31,503 --> 01:00:32,504
What are you doing?

1154
01:00:32,588 --> 01:00:34,131
Is sitting outside my apartment,

1155
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,109
some kind of police foreplay?
Are you wearing my knickers?

1156
01:00:36,133 --> 01:00:37,134
I'm doing my job.

1157
01:00:37,217 --> 01:00:38,510
Oh.

1158
01:00:38,594 --> 01:00:41,430
I see we've taken down
another major drug kingpin.

1159
01:00:41,513 --> 01:00:45,059
He got sent home from school
for setting the class pet free.

1160
01:00:45,142 --> 01:00:46,560
Hmm. Hamster?

1161
01:00:46,643 --> 01:00:49,104
Rabbit. Hey, listen to me.

1162
01:00:49,188 --> 01:00:51,940
There's some pretty nasty guys
in the hospital, you know, and

1163
01:00:52,024 --> 01:00:54,026
their description of
the deranged psycho

1164
01:00:54,109 --> 01:00:55,295
who put them there matches you.

1165
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:57,946
What? Come on. Little old me?

1166
01:00:58,030 --> 01:00:59,132
How could you possibly think

1167
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,300
I could do anything like that?

1168
01:01:00,324 --> 01:01:02,242
Don't fuck
around with me, Lindy.

1169
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:05,371
Okay, but not now,
I need you to look after this.

1170
01:01:05,454 --> 01:01:06,598
I'm not dumping
evidence for you!

1171
01:01:06,622 --> 01:01:08,123
I'm not asking you to.

1172
01:01:08,207 --> 01:01:10,376
Look, I'm... I'm
giving you the chance

1173
01:01:10,459 --> 01:01:11,710
to turn yourself in here.

1174
01:01:11,794 --> 01:01:14,463
Okay, I will! Just not yet.

1175
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:16,715
Hey, listen to me.

1176
01:01:16,799 --> 01:01:19,218
Fizel's not some
dickbag gangster, okay?

1177
01:01:19,301 --> 01:01:20,445
He's going to be looking for you

1178
01:01:20,469 --> 01:01:22,012
and he's going to kill you.

1179
01:01:22,096 --> 01:01:23,931
Right. Well, he already tried.

1180
01:01:24,014 --> 01:01:25,533
I think someone has
been in my apartment...

1181
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,184
Right, that's it.

1182
01:01:27,267 --> 01:01:29,353
- It ain't your choice anymore.
- No, no, no, no, no.

1183
01:01:29,436 --> 01:01:31,772
That's a very
bad idea. I've got...

1184
01:01:31,855 --> 01:01:33,399
this condition. Okay?

1185
01:01:33,482 --> 01:01:36,443
It makes me snap. I can't
control it and I hurt people.

1186
01:01:36,527 --> 01:01:38,946
I wear this thing,
that gives me electric shocks,

1187
01:01:39,029 --> 01:01:40,531
so that I can stop it happening.

1188
01:01:40,614 --> 01:01:42,491
But, really, I really
don't want to hurt you

1189
01:01:42,574 --> 01:01:44,618
or anybody else.

1190
01:01:45,619 --> 01:01:46,739
I don't think you'd hurt me.

1191
01:01:46,787 --> 01:01:48,455
- No?
- No.

1192
01:01:49,581 --> 01:01:51,083
Would you leave
me on my own with him?

1193
01:01:51,166 --> 01:01:52,543
[control clicking]

1194
01:01:52,626 --> 01:01:54,294
- Yeah.
- Bollocks!

1195
01:01:54,378 --> 01:01:56,130
Well, I don't think
you'd hurt him either.

1196
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:57,297
You sure?

1197
01:01:59,842 --> 01:02:01,093
What that thing feel like?

1198
01:02:08,142 --> 01:02:09,143
Come on?

1199
01:02:13,188 --> 01:02:14,440
- What are you...
- Here.

1200

- [electricity crackles]
- [grunts]

1201
01:02:24,366 --> 01:02:26,410
Okay, you know
what that tells me?

1202
01:02:26,493 --> 01:02:28,537
I'm way more
screwed up than you thought.

1203
01:02:28,620 --> 01:02:30,789
No. No, it tells me
that you'd rather hurt yourself

1204
01:02:30,873 --> 01:02:32,082
than somebody else.

1205
01:02:33,709 --> 01:02:35,127
Nevin says
I treat you different

1206
01:02:35,210 --> 01:02:36,378
because you're a woman.

1207
01:02:36,462 --> 01:02:37,838
She says...

1208
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:38,922
I'm going easy on you.

1209
01:02:39,006 --> 01:02:40,757
Is she right?

1210
01:02:40,841 --> 01:02:42,885
I treat you different
because you are different.

1211
01:02:46,763 --> 01:02:48,974
[people screaming]

1212
01:02:51,727 --> 01:02:53,395
Nobody is looking for me now.

1213
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:54,730
Lindy!

1214
01:02:54,813 --> 01:02:56,815
[screaming continues]

1215
01:02:58,066 --> 01:02:59,067
Whoa!

1216
01:02:59,151 --> 01:03:00,444
What's that?

1217
01:03:00,527 --> 01:03:01,987
Dad?

1218
01:03:02,905 --> 01:03:04,281

1222
01:03:15,542 --> 01:03:17,044
Lindy, listen to me!

1223
01:03:17,127 --> 01:03:19,046
[Lindy] I'm a little
busy at the moment.

1224
01:03:19,129 --> 01:03:21,173
Look, Lindy I don't
wanna play games anymore.

1225
01:03:21,256 --> 01:03:23,509
You have to stop
looking for Justin's killer.

1226
01:03:23,592 --> 01:03:24,718
You're gonna get hurt.

1227
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,720
I know what you're capable of.

1228
01:03:26,803 --> 01:03:28,163
I read all
about it in your file...

1229
01:03:28,222 --> 01:03:30,450
Okay. Are you done looking me up
on some bullshit database?

1230
01:03:30,474 --> 01:03:31,934
'Cause, listen, Detective.

1231
01:03:32,017 --> 01:03:34,353
I'm gonna do what I need to do.

1232
01:03:34,436 --> 01:03:36,438
[Vicars] Lindy I don't wanna
see you wind up dead.

1233
01:03:36,522 --> 01:03:37,856
Just let us do our job.

1234
01:03:37,940 --> 01:03:40,067
So, what?

1235
01:03:40,150 --> 01:03:42,945
Does that mean you are gonna
go in and arrest Fizel?

1236
01:03:43,904 --> 01:03:45,155
Yes, thought not.

1237

01:04:44,923 --> 01:04:45,924
[sighs]

1247
01:04:51,013 --> 01:04:52,264
You like lobster?

1248
01:04:54,266 --> 01:04:58,270
Uh, I always thought
it was overrated and overpriced.

1249
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:01,398
Most people don't realize

1250
01:05:01,481 --> 01:05:06,528
that lobster's belong in
the same biological phylum

1251
01:05:06,612 --> 01:05:08,030
as cockroaches.

1252
01:05:10,741 --> 01:05:14,870
They are both anthropods
with segmented bodies.

1253
01:05:14,953 --> 01:05:19,416
They both have the same compound
eyes and jointed legs.

1254
01:05:19,499 --> 01:05:22,461
Even their meat is the same.

1255
01:05:22,544 --> 01:05:24,963
Lobsters must be boiled alive.

1256
01:05:25,714 --> 01:05:27,299
Cockroaches poisoned.

1257
01:05:27,382 --> 01:05:29,468
Wow.

1258
01:05:29,551 --> 01:05:33,180
Ugly and boring.
What a winning combination.

1259
01:05:33,263 --> 01:05:35,098
What the fuck has
this got to do with me?

1260
01:05:36,016 --> 01:05:38,018
You are an odd specimen.

1261
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:45,734
Not sure what, uh,
phylum you belong in.

1262
01:05:45,817 --> 01:05:47,277
Me neither.

1263
01:05:47,361 --> 01:05:49,946
That's something my therapist
and I are really delving in to.

1264
01:05:51,198 --> 01:05:53,200
I understand
you are here to kill me.

1265
01:05:54,785 --> 01:05:56,536
Something about an accountant?

1266
01:05:57,871 --> 01:06:00,749
Your... boyfriend?

1267
01:06:00,832 --> 01:06:04,503
We hadn't put a label on
it, but he was pretty special.

1268
01:06:05,253 --> 01:06:06,755
I kill a lot of people,

1269
01:06:08,215 --> 01:06:11,468
I suppose some of them
may be accountants. I'm...

1270
01:06:12,678 --> 01:06:14,513
[Fizel laughs]

1271
01:06:15,472 --> 01:06:17,182
I'm sorry I killed yours.

1272
01:06:17,265 --> 01:06:18,642
Well, apology not accepted...

1273
01:06:18,725 --> 01:06:20,185
You creepy fuck.

1274
01:06:21,186 --> 01:06:22,521
Rude...

1275
01:06:23,438 --> 01:06:24,773
[chewing]

1276
01:06:25,899 --> 01:06:30,195
You are certainly
a... a rare species.

1277
01:06:31,571 --> 01:06:36,076
I'm glad I took this
opportunity to get one good,

1278
01:06:36,159 --> 01:06:38,745
long, hard look at you.

1279
01:06:40,414 --> 01:06:41,915
Okay, but can you do it...
[grunts]

1280
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,000
[ringing noise]

1281
01:06:48,714 --> 01:06:50,090
[groan] Without,

1282
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:52,718
whacking me on
the head this time.

1283
01:06:52,801 --> 01:06:53,802
Fuck.

1284
01:06:56,096 --> 01:06:57,180
Fuck.

1285
01:06:59,850 --> 01:07:00,851
Balls!

1286
01:07:00,934 --> 01:07:02,936
Fuck balls indeed.

1287
01:07:03,979 --> 01:07:05,856
I'm getting the feeling

1288
01:07:05,939 --> 01:07:08,316
there's no cookie
and juice after this.

1289
01:07:08,400 --> 01:07:09,609
Not for you.

1290
01:07:09,693 --> 01:07:11,194
[Lindy]
Wait, wait, wait!

1291
01:07:11,737 --> 01:07:13,155
Justin...

1292
01:07:14,281 --> 01:07:15,449
Did you pull the trigger?

1293
01:07:16,783 --> 01:07:20,036
No. I didn't.
Though I wish I had.

1294
01:07:20,120 --> 01:07:21,121
[hissing]

1295
01:07:21,204 --> 01:07:22,998
[Lindy grunting]

1296
01:07:23,081 --> 01:07:25,000
This is going
to take a sec so...

1297
01:07:25,083 --> 01:07:27,836
- Sit back, relax.
- Fuck!

1298
01:07:27,919 --> 01:07:29,679
- Enjoy the ride.
- What are you doing to me?

1299
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:31,006
[gurgling]

1300
01:07:31,089 --> 01:07:33,717
[Delacroix] Do you know what
exsanguination means?

1301
01:07:33,800 --> 01:07:36,762
The drainage of one's blood.

1302
01:07:36,845 --> 01:07:39,473
[panting]

Aah!

1313
01:08:12,506 --> 01:08:13,507
Aah!

1314

[Lindy grunts]

[Delacroix groans]

1319
01:08:34,361 --> 01:08:35,612
I have a few questions.

1320
01:08:36,738 --> 01:08:38,615
How do I get to Fizel?

1321
01:08:40,784 --> 01:08:41,785
[blade clanks]

[man] Hey! Where
do you think you're going?

[beeps]

1333
01:10:23,136 --> 01:10:24,596
Get ready to die, you sick fuck!

1334
01:10:28,767 --> 01:10:31,770
[heartbeat thumping]

1335
01:10:45,075 --> 01:10:46,451
Justin!

1336
01:10:46,534 --> 01:10:48,662
Bravo. Well done!

1337
01:10:50,580 --> 01:10:52,666
You know,
I gotta admit Lindy, uh...

1338
01:10:52,749 --> 01:10:53,893
Right toward the end there I...

1339
01:10:53,917 --> 01:10:55,835
I didn't think you had it in ya.

1340
01:10:55,919 --> 01:10:57,837
So, my apologies.

1341
01:10:57,921 --> 01:11:00,256
I decided to take
care of Fizel myself.

1342
01:11:02,801 --> 01:11:03,843
What are you covered in?

1343
01:11:03,927 --> 01:11:05,220
Is it that time of the month?

1344
01:11:06,763 --> 01:11:07,931
But you...

1345
01:11:08,974 --> 01:11:11,184
I saw you. How?

1346
01:11:11,267 --> 01:11:12,310
The guy in the casket?

1347
01:11:12,394 --> 01:11:14,312
[laughing] No.

1348
01:11:14,396 --> 01:11:16,189
Aah, some bum off the street.

1349
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:17,440
Jesus Christ!

1350
01:11:17,524 --> 01:11:19,109
[cork pops]

1351
01:11:19,192 --> 01:11:20,912
Yeah, I just paid
off the coroner, you know?

1352
01:11:21,820 --> 01:11:22,988
Why?

1353
01:11:23,071 --> 01:11:24,948
[Justin] I had to
get Fizel out of the way.

1354
01:11:25,031 --> 01:11:27,200
But the CIA can't
operate on US soil.

1355
01:11:28,368 --> 01:11:29,411
Even the government,

1356
01:11:29,494 --> 01:11:31,538
wouldn't be dumb
enough to go after him.

1357
01:11:31,621 --> 01:11:33,289
Exactly.

1358
01:11:33,373 --> 01:11:35,017
Yeah! I needed someone
from the outside, you know?

1359
01:11:35,041 --> 01:11:37,752
Someone to draw
the attention away from myself.

1360
01:11:37,836 --> 01:11:40,338
Someone who couldn't
be traced back to me.

1361
01:11:40,422 --> 01:11:41,756
So you chose me?

1362
01:11:42,465 --> 01:11:44,384
Why?

1363
01:11:44,467 --> 01:11:47,053
A glowing
recommendation from Dr. Munchin.

1364
01:11:47,137 --> 01:11:48,430
I mean, who do you think funds

1365
01:11:48,513 --> 01:11:50,306
his batshit crazy experiments?

1366
01:11:50,390 --> 01:11:51,808
But see, I...

1367
01:11:51,891 --> 01:11:54,644
I knew you
were something else. Yeah.

1368
01:11:54,728 --> 01:11:57,022
My little kamikaze K-9.

1369
01:11:57,105 --> 01:11:59,399
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1370
01:11:59,482 --> 01:12:02,277
Well, in the
Second World War, uh...

1371
01:12:02,360 --> 01:12:04,279
they strapped bombs to dogs

1372
01:12:04,362 --> 01:12:06,448
and they would train
them to run into enemy tanks.

1373
01:12:06,531 --> 01:12:07,824
Right?

1374
01:12:07,907 --> 01:12:09,719
The puppies thought they were
just gonna get a treat

1375
01:12:09,743 --> 01:12:12,579
or something, but they got
detonated into dog-burger.

1376
01:12:12,662 --> 01:12:13,955
Yeah.

1377
01:12:14,039 --> 01:12:15,582
So I just had
to figure out what treats

1378
01:12:15,665 --> 01:12:19,335
I needed to use
to train you to take out Fizel.

1379
01:12:19,419 --> 01:12:21,259
And if you failed or
got killed in the process,

1380
01:12:21,337 --> 01:12:23,131
well, you know? Cost me nothing.

1381
01:12:23,214 --> 01:12:25,133
That's why you were perfect.

1382
01:12:25,216 --> 01:12:26,551
Where's my car by the way?

1383
01:12:26,634 --> 01:12:29,054
Who the fuck are you?

1384
01:12:29,137 --> 01:12:30,346
Who am I?

1385
01:12:30,430 --> 01:12:31,473
[laughs]

1386
01:12:31,556 --> 01:12:33,308
I'm the only one
keeping this old shitbag

1387
01:12:33,391 --> 01:12:34,851
from killing innocent people!

1388
01:12:34,934 --> 01:12:37,103
Fizel was an asset
that became a liability.

1389
01:12:37,187 --> 01:12:38,271
Everybody wanted him dead,

1390
01:12:38,354 --> 01:12:39,397
but nobody can touch him.

1391
01:12:40,273 --> 01:12:43,151
And you think this masochistic

1392
01:12:43,234 --> 01:12:46,446
piece of shit
was ever gonna stop?

1393
01:12:46,529 --> 01:12:47,906
[sniffles]

1394
01:12:47,989 --> 01:12:51,117
Not so untouchable
anymore, are ya handsome?

1395
01:12:51,201 --> 01:12:52,535
Huh?

1396
01:12:52,619 --> 01:12:55,080
You lowlife piece of shit.

1397
01:12:55,163 --> 01:12:57,040
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

1398
01:12:57,123 --> 01:13:02,170
You could try. Or
we just... fuck instead.

1399
01:13:02,253 --> 01:13:03,588
[heartbeat thumping]

1400
01:13:03,671 --> 01:13:05,090

[Lindy screams, grunts]

1404
01:13:14,849 --> 01:13:17,519
What? We had fun, right?

1405
01:13:17,602 --> 01:13:20,855
[laughs] I mean,
you did all this for me?

1406
01:13:22,023 --> 01:13:24,109
You must really be into me.

1407
01:13:24,818 --> 01:13:26,319
[screams]

1408
01:13:26,402 --> 01:13:28,154
What the fuck?

1409
01:13:28,238 --> 01:13:29,739
[Justin]
Was that too strong for ya?

1410
01:13:29,823 --> 01:13:33,451
Oh, sorry. I did a bit of
tinkering. [laughs]

1411
01:13:33,535 --> 01:13:35,745
- Ow!
- [Lindy groans]

1412
01:13:35,829 --> 01:13:37,681
You know what though?
It's gonna turn out to be,

1413
01:13:37,705 --> 01:13:39,707
a really beautiful story, Lindy.

1414
01:13:39,791 --> 01:13:41,584
- [sobbing]
- Desperate, little

1415
01:13:41,668 --> 01:13:43,753
broken princess

1416
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:46,714
avenges the death
of her lover and then...

1417
01:13:46,798 --> 01:13:48,216
takes her own life.

1418
01:13:48,299 --> 01:13:49,634
[electricity crackles]

[Lindy grunts]

1420
01:13:51,136 --> 01:13:52,470
Motherfucker! [grunts]

1421
01:13:52,554 --> 01:13:53,805
[grunts]

1422
01:13:56,641 --> 01:13:57,642
Oops.

1423
01:13:57,725 --> 01:14:00,854
[laughs]

1424
01:14:00,937 --> 01:14:02,147
