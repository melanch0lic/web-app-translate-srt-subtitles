THE JAPANESE INVASION LEFT
THE SOUTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON IN RUINS.

7
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,942
AND NOW ANOTHER STORM WAS LOOMING
IN THE NORTHERN LANDS OF JOSEON.

8
00:01:50,735 --> 00:01:54,405
THE JURCHENS ACROSS THE MANCHURIAN
PLAIN NORTH OF THE AMNOK RIVER

9
00:01:54,489 --> 00:01:58,409
STARTED GATHERING AT THE BASIN

00:01:58,493 --> 00:02:02,831
UNDER THE FLAG
OF THE VICIOUS, POWERFUL PAJEOWI.

ANOTHER GROUP OF THE JURCHENS

THEY WERE JURCHENS LIVING IN JOSEON
CALLED "SEONGJEOYAIN".

00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:30,733
SINCE THEY HAD LIVED IN JOSEON
FOR OVER A CENTURY,

17
00:02:30,817 --> 00:02:33,987
THEY WERE NEITHER CONSIDERED
JURCHENS

00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:36,823
NOR ACCEPTED BY THE PEOPLE OF JOSEON
AS THEIR OWN

Well...
[sighs]

00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,021

According to the army,
it's against the law to enter Pyesa-gun.

I cannot believe
such a horrible thing happened there.

came back out alive.

You told me that
it was actually dangerous.

128
00:13:09,538 --> 00:13:12,458
You told me yourself that
people spread the rumors

129
00:13:12,541 --> 00:13:15,544
so they could take all the wild ginseng
for themselves.

That's why I told you not to go.

Are soldiers.

it can even bring back the dead.

- Why not Mom?
- You are not a ginseng hunter.

139
00:13:42,404 --> 00:13:45,491
How will you find the wild ginseng
in that huge mountain?

140
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,786
I'm not sure if it was wild ginseng,
but I saw a strange plant.

00:13:49,787 --> 00:13:53,582
It was drawn on a mural that said
that it can bring back the dead.

That's just nonsense.

Listen to me and do not go there.

Anybody who sneaked in there
and got caught,

00:14:08,305 --> 00:14:10,641
they were punished,
had their tongues cut out.

crossing the river to hunt wild ginseng
were all found dead.

159
00:15:08,073 --> 00:15:09,742
They are the Pajeowi Jurchens?

160
00:15:10,451 --> 00:15:11,619
Are you sure, my lord?

161
00:15:13,662 --> 00:15:17,166
But who... who would do something like that?

162
00:15:18,709 --> 00:15:20,085

00:15:25,215 --> 00:15:28,052
Go spread the word that
all the Pajeowi Jurchens...

166
00:15:29,011 --> 00:15:30,304
were killed by a tiger.

167

[suspenseful music continues]

168

Understood, my lord.

169
00:15:42,232 --> 00:15:45,527
[Tahab] When will my village
receive a government position?

170
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,363
An official one?

171
00:15:49,323 --> 00:15:51,241
We are very aware of your loyalty.

172
00:15:51,825 --> 00:15:54,370
Don't rush.
You must be patient and wait for it.

173
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:55,746
Good news will come soon.

Sir, we have brought all the corpses

[soldier] We've verified that
the limbs were torn by wild animals,

186
00:16:53,637 --> 00:16:55,681
but it happened after they died.

187
00:16:56,223 --> 00:16:57,558
It wasn't the tiger.

188
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:01,103
They were killed by humans.

189
00:17:02,438 --> 00:17:03,647
I am aware of it.

190
00:17:11,113 --> 00:17:13,282
If 10,000 Jurchens come together...

191

Pull out the knife and you shall be slain.

The Japanese in the south are

If the Pajeowi in the north uses this
as an excuse to invade us as well,

what will happen to this country?

207
00:18:26,814 --> 00:18:31,151
We can never let them know
those men were killed by our own people.

208

They weren't attacked by people.

209

They were attacked by a tiger.

[door closes]

The bodies of 15 dead Pajeowi Jurchens
were found in the pit.

222
00:19:27,708 --> 00:19:29,793
Are you certain there were 15 of them?

223
00:19:29,877 --> 00:19:30,877
Why?

224
00:19:31,587 --> 00:19:33,755
Are you saying that
I got the number wrong?

225
00:19:35,883 --> 00:19:38,802
[Chi-rok] I heard you went hunting
in the Birch Pass two days ago.

226
00:19:40,137 --> 00:19:41,263
[Beom-il scoffs]

227
00:19:43,849 --> 00:19:45,309
So tell me...

228
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:49,730
since when do I need your permission
to go hunting?

229
00:19:49,813 --> 00:19:54,318
Every single Pajeowi Jurchen receives
martial arts training from an early age.

230
00:19:54,985 --> 00:19:58,322
With that straight in training,
it would be nearly impossible

231
00:19:58,405 --> 00:20:00,574
to take down 15 of them at once.

232
00:20:00,657 --> 00:20:03,911
Unless it was you
and your elite guards who did it.

[bangs on table]

237

Those Jurchen rats...

238
00:20:36,443 --> 00:20:39,613
they dared to steal
the Haewon Cho Clan's wild ginseng.

239
00:20:39,696 --> 00:20:41,657
They all deserved to die.

240
00:20:42,324 --> 00:20:45,535
You should have captured them
and punished them according to the law.

241
00:20:46,578 --> 00:20:50,916
That wild ginseng, does not belong
to the Haewon Cho Clan.

242
00:20:50,999 --> 00:20:54,419
It belongs to His Majesty,
the King of this country.

- [sword clinks]

Do you think you can insult me
and my family like this

245
00:21:04,221 --> 00:21:06,056
just because I'm stuck...

246
00:21:07,224 --> 00:21:08,850
here in the boondocks?

247
00:21:08,934 --> 00:21:11,812
You abandoned your people
and fled during the war.

248
00:21:11,895 --> 00:21:13,563
That is why you're here.

249
00:21:13,647 --> 00:21:18,151
If you commit a crime
and endanger this country once again,

250
00:21:18,235 --> 00:21:20,988
you won't be able to avoid
the consequences.

Even if you are from the Haewon Cho Clan.

The people are growing anxious,

253
00:21:31,707 --> 00:21:35,544
so I will begin a tiger hunt
to calm their anxiety.

254
00:21:37,337 --> 00:21:41,466
You would do well to stay where you are
and keep out of trouble.

[Ashin] Are you sure it was a tiger?

00:22:57,959 --> 00:23:00,712
The Pajeowi learned martial arts
as soon as they can walk.

267
00:23:02,464 --> 00:23:04,674
They all got killed by one tiger?

no one will like it
when they find out the truth.

273
00:23:29,199 --> 00:23:31,118
It might put you in danger, Father.

274

Being undercover...

275
00:23:35,372 --> 00:23:37,332

it's your job to look after the family.

00:23:44,548 --> 00:23:45,799
[Tahab] All right, then.

279

[panting]

280
00:23:50,971 --> 00:23:54,057
Father, let's go back to our clan
and cross the river.

281
00:23:54,141 --> 00:23:55,767
You let them take all your pelts

282
00:23:55,851 --> 00:23:58,520
and risk your life
to go undercover for them.

283
00:23:59,563 --> 00:24:02,274
Are you gonna let them walk
all over you forever?

284
00:24:06,486 --> 00:24:10,782
Pyesa-gun is where
our ancestors used to lived.

[inhales]

286
00:24:12,367 --> 00:24:15,245
The King of Joseon bestowed the land
upon our clan,

00:24:15,328 --> 00:24:18,039
we were battling hunger and thieves
on the barren fields

288

on the other side of the river.

289
00:24:19,875 --> 00:24:22,043
The King offered us a public office

290
00:24:22,752 --> 00:24:25,046
and exempted us from paying taxes.

291
00:24:30,010 --> 00:24:31,136
Joseon...

292
00:24:32,095 --> 00:24:34,139
he was very gracious to us.

293
00:24:34,764 --> 00:24:37,309
Hence, I cannot betray Joseon.
Do you understand?

294
00:24:43,940 --> 00:24:46,818
They may have been gracious
to our ancestors,

295
00:24:46,902 --> 00:24:49,529
but they've taken back everything
they gave us.

296

Hang in there just a little longer.

Joseon's highest mountain.

this tiger is 1,000 years old.

00:26:43,518 --> 00:26:46,187
it even transforms into a human like us.

No, for real!

326
00:26:53,236 --> 00:26:56,156
Thousands of men have gone
into the mountains

327
00:26:56,239 --> 00:26:59,034
and met their death
trying to catch the tiger.

- [indistinct chatter]

Look, haven't you heard
of the Pajeowi Jurchens

330
00:27:05,707 --> 00:27:07,584
who climbed the Birch Pass recently?

331
00:27:08,501 --> 00:27:10,879
They all got eaten by that tiger.

332
00:27:10,962 --> 00:27:12,422
[crowd derides]

333
00:27:12,505 --> 00:27:14,799
- [Jurchen 1] Is that true?
- [Jurchen 2] No way.

334
00:27:14,883 --> 00:27:15,883
It is.

335
00:27:17,052 --> 00:27:18,803
I saw it with my own eyes.

336
00:27:19,387 --> 00:27:21,014
[sheepish laugh]

337
00:27:21,097 --> 00:27:23,808
Really?
[cackles]

338
00:27:28,480 --> 00:27:30,065
If you're lying to us...

339
00:27:34,027 --> 00:27:35,195
you will die.

340

[Chi-rok] <i>Our hunt will take place
in the Birch Pass.</i>

354
00:29:41,112 --> 00:29:43,323
We will begin in these two areas.

355
00:29:43,823 --> 00:29:45,784
The Chupajin soldiers will spread out,

356
00:29:45,867 --> 00:29:48,077
guard the trails and go after them.

357
00:29:48,161 --> 00:29:49,329
We'll lure them out...

358
00:29:51,706 --> 00:29:52,706
to here.

359
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:56,085
[soldier] You want to lure them out
to Pyesa-gun.

360
00:29:58,630 --> 00:29:59,756
Do not forget.

361
00:29:59,839 --> 00:30:01,674
We will only pretend to hunt them.

00:30:02,175 --> 00:30:05,428
[all clamoring]

363
00:30:06,554 --> 00:30:07,555
[leader] Quiet now!

364
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:10,475
All right, when hunting a tiger,

365
00:30:10,558 --> 00:30:13,770
you shouldn't go too slow or too fast.

366
00:30:13,853 --> 00:30:14,896
If we are too fast,

367
00:30:14,979 --> 00:30:17,482
we might get attack by the tiger.

368
00:30:18,441 --> 00:30:21,319
- All right. Let's go!
- [hunters] Let's go!

369

[soldier 1] That's a tiger's paw print
right there.

373
00:30:46,845 --> 00:30:48,137
This is very odd.

374
00:30:49,264 --> 00:30:52,892
Tigers hate the sound of gongs,
so it should be avoiding it,

375
00:30:52,976 --> 00:30:54,102
but it's not running away.

376
00:30:55,019 --> 00:30:56,437
What do you mean by that?

377
00:30:57,564 --> 00:30:59,274
[soldier 1] That it's coming toward us.

[leader 1] No, it's not a tiger.

It's a monster.
[grunts]

Tell the hunters to fall back.

We were told that
our brothers were killed by a tiger.

Then where are their flesh and bones?

They are the one who crossed the borders

and entered Pyesa-gun,
which is against the law.

There is no reason for us
to be held responsible for their deaths.

Our brothers died on Joseon soil.

00:42:56,115 --> 00:42:57,783
I've heard that...

493
00:42:57,866 --> 00:42:59,618
[breathing shakily]

494
00:43:01,829 --> 00:43:04,790
the Pajeowi have executed a spy
from Joseon.

495
00:43:06,250 --> 00:43:09,003
Did you cross the river
and go all the way there?

496
00:43:10,671 --> 00:43:12,506
I don't understand what happened.

497
00:43:13,299 --> 00:43:15,467
[shaky breath]

498
00:43:16,844 --> 00:43:19,263
Why would the Pajeowi do this to us?

499
00:43:22,850 --> 00:43:26,061
I have been racking my brain
but I don't get it.

500
00:43:27,938 --> 00:43:30,899
Have you come to see me
to find out why it happened?

501
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:33,444
No, sir.

502
00:43:34,695 --> 00:43:37,072
[sobbing]

503
00:43:37,156 --> 00:43:38,866
That doesn't matter to me at all.

504
00:43:42,536 --> 00:43:45,623
I beg you. Avenge my father.

505
00:43:47,958 --> 00:43:50,377
A lowborn weakling like me cannot do it.

506
00:43:52,046 --> 00:43:53,589
But Joseon can.

507
00:43:54,089 --> 00:43:56,342
You have the power to punish them.

508
00:43:56,425 --> 00:43:58,135
I'm sorry for your loss,

509
00:43:58,636 --> 00:44:02,139
but this is not a matter for Joseon
to intervene in.

510
00:44:02,222 --> 00:44:03,223
My father...

511
00:44:05,184 --> 00:44:07,436
was loyal to Joseon all his life.

512
00:44:12,566 --> 00:44:16,153
Although you never did the right thing
and gave him an official post...

513
00:44:17,905 --> 00:44:20,199
you could at least do this for him now.

514
00:44:22,368 --> 00:44:24,370
[Ashin] It, it doesn't have to be
right away.

515
00:44:24,912 --> 00:44:27,790
Next year or the following year...

516
00:44:28,999 --> 00:44:30,834
or even a decade from now.

517
00:44:35,798 --> 00:44:38,926
Please make them all shed tears of blood.

518
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,639
Then I will make peace with it.

519
00:44:44,556 --> 00:44:46,058
I will do anything.

520
00:44:46,767 --> 00:44:49,144
I will be your loyal spy if you want,

521
00:44:49,228 --> 00:44:51,772
or even work as a butcher
if you tell me to.

522
00:44:54,566 --> 00:44:58,654
Even if it's something nastier,
I will gladly do anything.

[shaky breath]

524
00:45:04,701 --> 00:45:08,455
Please avenge... the death of my father.

Let's take care of this child.

The peace conference with the Japanese
